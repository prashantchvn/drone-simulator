## Drone-simulator using MERN

### Setup the backend
#### Setup mongoose
To setup the mongoose you can mail me you ip address so that I can add your IP in mongo online database cluster
you can drop a mail with ip address on prashantch451@gmail.com

#### Setup Express and Node.js
Note : Make sure you are running node version 14 to change node version type `nvm use 14`
change directory to backend `cd ../backend`
run `npm i`
once it is finished type `npm run dev` to run our backend 

#### Start our frontend react app
Note : Make sure you are running both terminals parallely and using node version 14

change directory to drone-simulator `cd drone-simulator`
run `npm i`
once installation is complete run `npm start`

Now we are running both frontend and backend you can play with the app

Thank You
